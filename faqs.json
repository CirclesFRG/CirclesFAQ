        "question": "If you delete a coordinator, will you delete the young person's data?",
        "answer": "No the young person's information will return to the administrator so that it can be assigned to a different coordinator or social worker."
    },
    {
        "question": "I am a Circles administrator, can I complete the questionnaire with a young person?",
        "answer": "No, administrator accounts cannot be used to complete Circles questionnaires. You will need to create a separate coordinator/social worker account using a different email address."
    },
    {
        "question": "I am an administrator, how can I reset my password?",
        "answer": "1. Ask another administrator to reset your password by following the steps in the set-up guide. 2. Contact Family Rights Group who will support you to gain access to your account using either the Emergency Access Codes or by giving temporary permission to set-up a trusted colleague as an additional administrator."

        "question": "Can foster carers or children's home staff use Circles with young people?",
        "answer": "No, a coordinator, PA, or social worker should use Circles with a young person. Our experience has shown that young people may face divided loyalties if a foster carer completes Circles with them and it may not be a true reflection of their network."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can young people use Circles themselves?",
        "answer": "Yes, if a young person is over 18 years old their Circles questionnaire can me forwarded to them to complete on their own. Our advice is that you ensure the young person is supported or has access to support if doing this on their own. Some of the questions may trigger an emotional response and it is important that someone is around to help if needed."

    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between deleting an account and revoking access to an account?",
        "answer": "Administrators can permanently delete the accounts of former administrators. Former coordinators or social workers can only have their access revoked. This access can be reinstated at any time."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I filter data using specific data points?",
        "answer": "Data can be filtered by 'under-16' and 'over-16', 'receiving Lifelong Links' and 'not receiving Lifelong Links'. There will soon be more filters available."

        "question": "Can a social worker and coordinator use Circles for the same young person at the same time?",
        "answer": "No, the young person can only be assigned to either the coordinator or the social worker and not both at the same time."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have lost my administrator password and Emergency Access Codes",

    },
    {
        "question": "Can I change a young person's Circles ID?",
        "answer": "No, this is automatically generated and cannot be changed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Who will be able to view a young person's answers?",
        "answer": "The young personâ€™s social worker will be able to view the answers from any past Circles questionnaires. The Lifelong Links coordinator will only be able to view the Circles questionnaire that they complete with a young person. They will not be able to view past questionnaires nor will then be able to log in and look at questionnaires completed at a future date. Neither Family Rights Group nor Atto (the web developers) will have access to child-specific data."

    },
    {
        "question": "The young person has changed their name, will the affect Circles?",
        "answer": "No, Circles uses a date of birth and Child ID. A change of name will not affect the Circles database."
