        "question": "What is Circles?",
        "answer": "Circles is a questionnaire which explores who is important to a child or a young person (who is or has been in care) and/or who they rely on and in what way. The questionnaire has been designed as an integral part of Lifelong Links. It has been developed in consultation with young people in care and care leavers, social workers and their managers, family group conference managers and coordinators, and academics. In addition to being used as part of Lifelong Links, Circles is also intended to be used as a social work tool for other children in care. Circles helps practitioners explore, from the child’s perspective, who is important to them, the extent of their support network and in what ways members of their network are helping or may help them. Please contact us if you are interested in finding out more: Circles@frg.org.uk and watch a short video about circles here: https://frg.org.uk/lifelong-links/lifelong-links-circles/"

        "question": "If you delete a coordinator, will you delete the young person's data?",
        "answer": "No the young person's information will return to the administrator so that it can be assigned to a different coordinator or social worker."
    },
    {
        "question": "I am a Circles administrator, can I complete the questionnaire with a young person?",
        "answer": "No, administrator accounts cannot be used to complete Circles questionnaires. You will need to create a separate coordinator/social worker account using a different email address."
    },
    {
        "question": "I am an administrator, how can I reset my password?",
        "answer": "1. Ask another administrator to reset your password by following the steps in the set-up guide. 2. Contact Family Rights Group who will support you to gain access to your account using either the Emergency Access Codes or by giving temporary permission to set-up a trusted colleague as an additional administrator."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can Personal Advisers (PAs) use Circles with young people?",
        "answer": "Yes, this function is now available and they are added in the same way that a coordiantor or social worker is added. Just click on the Personal Adviser tab on the admin screen and press the + button."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can foster carers or children's home staff use Circles with young people?",
        "answer": "No, a coordinator, PA, or social worker should use Circles with a young person. Our experience has shown that young people may face divided loyalties if a foster carer completes Circles with them and it may not be a true reflection of their network."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can young people use Circles themselves?",
        "answer": "Yes, if a young person is over 18 years old their Circles questionnaire can me forwarded to them to complete on their own. Our advice is that you ensure the young person is supported or has access to support if doing this on their own. Some of the questions may trigger an emotional response and it is important that someone is around to help if needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can questionnaires be deleted?",
        "answer": "Yes, if an error was made with a questionnaire, they can be deleted."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is every Circles ID (e.g. Red Cheetah 23) individual to my organisation?",
        "answer": "Yes, each young person will have a completely unique Circles ID."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between deleting an account and revoking access to an account?",
        "answer": "Administrators can permanently delete the accounts of former administrators. Former coordinators or social workers can only have their access revoked. This access can be reinstated at any time."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I filter data using specific data points?",
        "answer": "Data can be filtered by 'under-16' and 'over-16', 'receiving Lifelong Links' and 'not receiving Lifelong Links'. There will soon be more filters available."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I assign a young person to a coordinator?",
        "answer": "Please follow the steps in the Admin Set-Up Guide."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I assign a young person to a social worker?",
        "answer": "Please follow the steps in the Admin Set-Up Guide."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can a social worker and coordinator use Circles for the same young person at the same time?",
        "answer": "No, the young person can only be assigned to either the coordinator or the social worker and not both at the same time."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have lost my administrator password and Emergency Access Codes",
        "answer": "Please contact Circles@frg.org.uk to get help with this issue."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Child ID?",
        "answer": "Child ID refers to a unique identification number for the child you would like to enter onto the Circles system. This is usually the child's file identification number (i.e., the number that you would use on your electronic system) or their Unique Pupil Number (UPN). No personal details (like names) should be entered."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Circles ID?",
        "answer": "Circles ID is the unique identification pseudonym for each child or young person on the Circles system. It involves randomly assigning a name using a colour, an animal, and a number (e.g., Red Panda 34). This name is automatically generated and cannot be changed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I change a young person's Circles ID?",
        "answer": "No, this is automatically generated and cannot be changed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Who will be able to view a young person's answers?",
        "answer": "The young person’s social worker will be able to view the answers from any past Circles questionnaires. The Lifelong Links coordinator will only be able to view the Circles questionnaire that they complete with a young person. They will not be able to view past questionnaires nor will then be able to log in and look at questionnaires completed at a future date. Neither Family Rights Group nor Atto (the web developers) will have access to child-specific data."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can Circles be used outside of Lifelong Links?",
        "answer": "Yes, Circles can be used by social work teams with other children in care."

    {
        "question": "Can I create my own sub-groups to collect data on (for example unaccompanied asylum-seeking children or children in residential care)?",

    },
    {
        "question": "What data output will I see once we have started using Circles with young people?",

    },
    {
        "question": "Can the child's ID contain their name?",
        "answer": "No, it is very important for data protection reasons that no personal details, such as their name, are entered onto the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "Do I use our own email address or a generic email address to register as a Circles administrator?",
        "answer": "You can use either. However, if you wish to use Circles with a young person, you should use your work email for this and the generic email address for the administrator. Please contact Circles@frg.org.uk and we'll be happy to explain."
    },
    {
        "question": "If your FRG contract ends, do you lose access to Circles?",
        "answer": "Currently, only those with a FRG contract will be able to access Circles. If this may affect you, please talk to us - Circles@frg.org.uk"
    },
    {
        "question": "When assigning multiple young people to one Coordinator, can you do this together or do they need to be assigned individually?",
        "answer": "They can only be added to a coordinator one at a time. However, this is quite a speedy process when you know the Circles ID of the young people whom you'd like to add. We may make multiple additions possible in future updates."
    },
    {
        "question": "I am a coordinator, how can I reset my password?",
        "answer": "Simply contact your Circles administrator. This will be a person in your own organisation (not Family Rights Group). They will be able to reset your password."
    },
        {
        "question": "Where is Circles data stored?",
        "answer": "The Circles database is securely stored within Amazon’s data centre in Dublin. It will remain within the EEA and not be transferred outside it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What information does Family Rights Group see?",
        "answer": "Family Rights Group will be able to view high level analytics of the data that has been collected. Family Rights Group will not be able to view or access the individual responses to Circles."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why does Family Rights Group need access to the data?",
        "answer": "Circles was originally developed to help evaluate the effectiveness of Lifelong Links as well as be a helpful practice tool. The high level metrics helped monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of Lifelong Links as well as using the data to report to funders. Such high level data is also necessary to monitor the use of Circles itself, and understand how it is being used as a practice tool. Family Rights Group only has access to anonymised aggregated results without any need for access to personal identification."
    },
    {
        "question": "Who are Atto?",

    },
    {
        "question": "How do I save the completed Circles summary so I can save it to he child's electronic file?",
        "answer": "Yes, presently you can print this from your browser in the same way you would print out a web page. Soon we will have a print to PDF function on the screen to make this easier and more aesthetic. Alternatively the summary can also be captured using 'print screen' and saved as a picture or added to a word document."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I print off the questions before I do use Circles with a young person?",
        "answer": "No, the questions cannot be printed off and the questionnaire can only be input online. If the screen interface is not going to be accessible for the young person you are working with, we recommend reading out the questions from the screen or answering these questions using different mediums (e.g., conversation, play, activities)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many times can you do a Cirles questionnaire with a young person?",

    },
    {
        "question": "Can a social worker and coordinator use Circles for the same child?",
        "answer": "Yes, but not at the same time. We recommend that the best person to use Circles with the young person is identified at the Lifelong Links planning meeting. Coordinators can 'hand over' Circles to the social worker after Lifelong Links is completed or at any other stage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What devices are compatible with Circles?",
        "answer": "Circles can be used on mobile devices, tablets and laptops. If you experience any technical difficulties, please email circles@frg.org.uk for support."

    },
    {
        "question": "I have started a new questionnaire and there are already names and avatars there.",

    },
    {

    },
    {
        "question": "Can young people under 18 have the Circles questionnaire sent to them via a link?",
        "answer": "Yes, but this should only be done if there is no other option and with serious consideration as to the environment the young person will complete Circles in. There should be organised support available for them when they do. The support person should know what Circles is and be aware of what support the young person may need."
    },
        {
        "question": "How often should Circles be offered?",
        "answer": "Circles is intended as an ongoing practice tool. It can be used before during and after Lifelong Links, but can also be used periodically by a social worker to see how a child or young person's network changes over time."

        "answer": "Yes, each question has a plus (+) button available. Simply click on the plus to add more people.

The <a href='https://frg.org.uk/lifelong-links/lifelong-links-circles/' target='_blank'>Circles film</a> will show you haw to do it."
    },
    {
        "question": "How will Circles help with Lifelong Links work and the Lifelong Links family group conference?",
        "answer": "The information you discover when using Circles will help identify people that the young person may want at their Lifelong Links family group conference (FGC). It may also help identify any gaps in the young person's network - for example, they do not have enough people to help them speak up at meetings."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can Circles include people that were important in the past?",
        "answer": "Technically yes, it can include anyone. However, it is designed to look at the young person's current support network. They should be allowed complete freedom to include who they would like. The wording at the start of the questionnaire will help steer everyone in the right direction."
