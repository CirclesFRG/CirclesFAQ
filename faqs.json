        "question": "What is Circles?",
        "answer": "Circles is a questionnaire which explores who is important to a child or a young person (who is or has been in care) and/or who they rely on and in what way. The questionnaire has been designed as an integral part of Lifelong Links. It has been developed in consultation with young people in care and care leavers, social workers and their managers, family group conference managers and coordinators, and academics. In addition to being used as part of Lifelong Links, Circles is also intended to be used as a social work tool for other children in care. Circles helps practitioners explore, from the child’s perspective, who is important to them, the extent of their support network and in what ways members of their network are helping or may help them. Please contact us if you are interested in finding out more: Circles@frg.org.uk and watch a short video about circles here: https://frg.org.uk/lifelong-links/lifelong-links-circles/"

        "question": "If you delete a coordinator, will you delete the young person's data?",
        "answer": "No the young person's information will return to the administrator so that it can be assigned to a different coordinator or social worker."
    },
    {
        "question": "I am a Circles administrator, can I complete the questionnaire with a young person?",
        "answer": "No, administrator accounts cannot be used to complete Circles questionnaires. You will need to create a separate coordinator/social worker account using a different email address."
    },
    {
        "question": "I am an administrator, how can I reset my password?",
        "answer": "1. Ask another administrator to reset your password by following the steps in the set-up guide. 2. Contact Family Rights Group who will support you to gain access to your account using either the Emergency Access Codes or by giving temporary permission to set-up a trusted colleague as an additional administrator."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can Personal Advisers (PAs) use Circles with young people?",
        "answer": "Yes, this function is now available and they are added in the same way that a coordiantor or social worker is added. Just click on the Personal Adviser tab on the admin screen and press the + button."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can foster carers or children's home staff use Circles with young people?",
        "answer": "No, a coordinator, PA, or social worker should use Circles with a young person. Our experience has shown that young people may face divided loyalties if a foster carer completes Circles with them and it may not be a true reflection of their network."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can young people use Circles themselves?",
        "answer": "Yes, if a young person is over 18 years old their Circles questionnaire can me forwarded to them to complete on their own. Our advice is that you ensure the young person is supported or has access to support if doing this on their own. Some of the questions may trigger an emotional response and it is important that someone is around to help if needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can questionnaires be deleted?",
        "answer": "Yes, if an error was made with a questionnaire, they can be deleted."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is every Circles ID (e.g. Red Cheetah 23) individual to my organisation?",
        "answer": "Yes, each young person will have a completely unique Circles ID."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between deleting an account and revoking access to an account?",
        "answer": "Administrators can permanently delete the accounts of former administrators. Former coordinators or social workers can only have their access revoked. This access can be reinstated at any time."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I filter data using specific data points?",
        "answer": "Data can be filtered by 'under-16' and 'over-16', 'receiving Lifelong Links' and 'not receiving Lifelong Links'. There will soon be more filters available."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I assign a young person to a coordinator?",
        "answer": "Please follow the steps in the Admin Set-Up Guide."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I assign a young person to a social worker?",
        "answer": "Please follow the steps in the Admin Set-Up Guide."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can a social worker and coordinator use Circles for the same young person at the same time?",
        "answer": "No, the young person can only be assigned to either the coordinator or the social worker and not both at the same time."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have lost my administrator password and Emergency Access Codes",
        "answer": "Please contact Circles@frg.org.uk to get help with this issue."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Child ID?",
        "answer": "Child ID refers to a unique identification number for the child you would like to enter onto the Circles system. This is usually the child's file identification number (i.e., the number that you would use on your electronic system) or their Unique Pupil Number (UPN). No personal details (like names) should be entered."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Circles ID?",
        "answer": "Circles ID is the unique identification pseudonym for each child or young person on the Circles system. It involves randomly assigning a name using a colour, an animal, and a number (e.g., Red Panda 34). This name is automatically generated and cannot be changed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I change a young person's Circles ID?",
        "answer": "No, this is automatically generated and cannot be changed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Who will be able to view a young person's answers?",
        "answer": "The young person’s social worker will be able to view the answers from any past Circles questionnaires. The Lifelong Links coordinator will only be able to view the Circles questionnaire that they complete with a young person. They will not be able to view past questionnaires nor will then be able to log in and look at questionnaires completed at a future date. Neither Family Rights Group nor Atto (the web developers) will have access to child-specific data."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can Circles be used outside of Lifelong Links?",
        "answer": "Yes, Circles can be used by social work teams with other children in care."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I create my own sub-groups to collect data on (for example unaccompanied asylum-seeking children or children in residential care)?",
        "answer": "Not presently. Family Rights Group will let you know when future feature will be available and any work-arounds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data output will I see once we have started using Circles with young people?",
        "answer": "Please visit <a href='https://frg.org.uk/lifelong-links/lifelong-links/circles/' target='_blank'>Family Rights Group's Circles web page</a> to stay up-to-date."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the child's ID contain their name?",
        "answer": "No, it is very important for data protection reasons that no personal details, such as their name, are entered onto the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "Do I use our own email address or a generic email address to register as a Circles administrator?",
        "answer": "You can use either. However, if you wish to use Circles with a young person, you should use your work email for this and the generic email address for the administrator. Please contact Circles@frg.org.uk and we'll be happy to explain."
    },
    {
        "question": "If your FRG contract ends, do you lose access to Circles?",
        "answer": "Currently, only those with a FRG contract will be able to access Circles. If this may affect you, please talk to us - Circles@frg.org.uk"
    },
    {
        "question": "When assigning multiple young people to one Coordinator, can you do this together or do they need to be assigned individually?",
        "answer": "They can only be added to a coordinator one at a time. However, this is quite a speedy process when you know the Circles ID of the young people whom you'd like to add. We may make multiple additions possible in future updates."
    },
    {
        "question": "I am a coordinator, how can I reset my password?",
        "answer": "Simply contact your Circles administrator. This will be a person in your own organisation (not Family Rights Group). They will be able to reset your password."
