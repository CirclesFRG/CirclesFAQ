        "question": "What is Circles?",
        "answer": "Circles is a questionnaire which explores who is important to a child or a young person (who is or has been in care) and/or who they rely on and in what way. The questionnaire has been designed as an integral part of Lifelong Links. It has been developed in consultation with young people in care and care leavers, social workers and their managers, family group conference managers and coordinators, and academics. In addition to being used as part of Lifelong Links, Circles is also intended to be used as a social work tool for other children in care. Circles helps practitioners explore, from the child’s perspective, who is important to them, the extent of their support network and in what ways members of their network are helping or may help them. Please contact us if you are interested in finding out more: Circles@frg.org.uk and watch a short video about circles here: https://frg.org.uk/lifelong-links/lifelong-links-circles/"

        "question": "If you delete a coordinator, will you delete the young person's data?",
        "answer": "No the young person's information will return to the administrator so that it can be assigned to a different coordinator or social worker."
    },
    {
        "question": "I am a Circles administrator, can I complete the questionnaire with a young person?",
        "answer": "No, administrator accounts cannot be used to complete Circles questionnaires. You will need to create a separate coordinator/social worker account using a different email address. You can <a href='https://github.com/CirclesFRG/CirclesFAQ/blob/main/Files/Reset%20adminitrator%20password.pdf' target='_blank'>read this PDF guide</a> for more information."
    }
    {
        "question": "I am an administrator, how can I reset my password?",
        "answer": "1. Ask another administrator to reset your password by following the steps in the set-up guide. 2. Contact Family Rights Group who will support you to gain access to your account using either the Emergency Access Codes or by giving temporary permission to set-up a trusted colleague as an additional administrator."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can Personal Advisers (PAs) use Circles with young people?",
        "answer": "Yes, this function is now available and they are added in the same way that a coordiantor or social worker is added. Just click on the Personal Adviser tab on the admin screen and press the + button."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can foster carers or children's home staff use Circles with young people?",
        "answer": "No, a coordinator, PA, or social worker should use Circles with a young person. Our experience has shown that young people may face divided loyalties if a foster carer completes Circles with them and it may not be a true reflection of their network."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can young people use Circles themselves?",
        "answer": "Yes, if a young person is over 18 years old their Circles questionnaire can be forwarded to them to complete on their own. Our advice is that you ensure the young person is supported or has access to support if doing this on their own. Some of the questions may trigger an emotional response and it is important that someone is around to help if needed.

    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between deleting an account and revoking access to an account?",
        "answer": "Administrators can permanently delete the accounts of former administrators. Former coordinators or social workers can only have their access revoked. This access can be reinstated at any time."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I filter data using specific data points?",
        "answer": "Data can be filtered by 'under-16' and 'over-16', 'receiving Lifelong Links' and 'not receiving Lifelong Links'. There will soon be more filters available."

    {
        "question": "I have lost my administrator password and Emergency Access Codes",
        "answer": "Please contact Circles@frg.org.uk to get help with this issue."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Child ID?",
        "answer": "Child ID refers to a unique identification number for the child you would like to enter onto the Circles system. This is usually the child's file identification number (i.e., the number that you would use on your electronic system) or their Unique Pupil Number (UPN). No personal details (like names) should be entered."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Circles ID?",
        "answer": "Circles ID is the unique identification pseudonym for each child or young person on the Circles system. It involves randomly assigning a name using a colour, an animal, and a number (e.g., Red Panda 34). This name is automatically generated and cannot be changed."

The Lifelong Links coordinator will only be able to view the Circles questionnaire that they complete with a young person. They will not be able to view past questionnaires nor will then be able to log in and look at questionnaires completed at a future date. Neither Family Rights Group nor Atto (the web developers) will have access to child-specific data."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can Circles be used outside of Lifelong Links?",
        "answer": "Yes, Circles can be used by social work teams with other children in care."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I create my own sub-groups to collect data on (for example unaccompanied asylum-seeking children or children in residential care)?",
        "answer": "Not presently. Family Rights Group will let you know when future feature will be available and any work-arounds."
    },
    {
        "question": "What data output will I see once we have started using Circles with young people?",
        "answer": "Please visit <a href='https://frg.org.uk/lifelong-links/lifelong-links/circles/' target='_blank'>Family Rights Group's Circles web page</a> to stay up-to-date."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can the child's ID contain their name?",
        "answer": "No, it is very important for data protection reasons that no personal details, such as their name, are entered onto the system."
    },
    {
        "question": "Do I use our own email address or a generic email address to register as a Circles administrator?",
        "answer": "You can use either. However, if you wish to use Circles with a young person, you should use your work email for this and the generic email address for the administrator. Please contact Circles@frg.org.uk and we'll be happy to explain."
    },
    {
        "question": "If your FRG contract ends, do you lose access to Circles?",

    },
    {
        "question": "When assigning multiple young people to one coordinator, can you do this together or do they need to be assigned individually?",
        "answer": "They can only be added to a coordinator one at a time. However, this is quite a speedy process when you know the Circles ID of the young people whom you'd like to add. We may make multiple additions possible in future updates."
    },
    {
        "question": "I am a coordinator, how can I reset my password?",
        "answer": "Simply contact your Circles administrator. This will be a person in your own organisation (not Family Rights Group). They will be able to reset your password.

        "answer": "Family Rights Group will be able to view high level analytics of the data that has been collected. Family Rights Group will not be able to view or access the individual responses to Circles."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why does Family Rights Group need access to the data?",
        "answer": "Circles was originally developed to help evaluate the effectiveness of Lifelong Links as well as be a helpful practice tool. The high level metrics helped monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of Lifelong Links as well as using the data to report to funders. Such high level data is also necessary to monitor the use of Circles itself, and understand how it is being used as a practice tool. Family Rights Group only has access to anonymised aggregated results without any need for access to personal identification."

        "answer": "Yes, presently you can print this from your browser in the same way you would print out a web page. Soon we will have a print to PDF function on the screen to make this easier and more aesthetic. Alternatively the summary can also be captured using 'print screen' and saved as a picture or added to a word document."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I print off the questions before I use Circles with a young person?",
        "answer": "No, the questions cannot be printed off and the questionnaire can only be input online. We recommend reading out the questions from the screen or answering these questions using different mediums (e.g., conversation, play, activities). If you are needing to use Circles where there is no internet (e.g., in prisons) then please contact circles@frg.org.uk for advice on how to do this."

    },

    },
    {
        "question": "What devices are compatible with Circles?",

    },
    {
        "question": "Can I use Circles with no internet?",

    },
    {
        "question": "Can I save a questionnaire half way through",
        "answer": "Yes, all progress will be saved. When you log back on to your Circles account and click on the child's Circles ID, you will see a section saying 'incomplete questionnaires'."
    },
    {
        "question": "When the link is sent to the young person, can it go as text, WhatsApp as well as email?",
        "answer": "Yes, Circles will generate a link which can be sent by text, email or any other means. <a href='https://github.com/CirclesFRG/CirclesFAQ/blob/main/Files/Send%20questionnaire%20to%20young%20person.pdf' target='_blank'>See our practice guide for more information</a>."
    }
    {
        "question": "Can young people under 18 have the Circles questionnaire sent to them via a link?",
        "answer": "Yes, but this should only be done if there is no other option and with serious consideration as to the environment the young person will complete Circles in. There should be organised support available for them when they do. The support person should know what Circles is and be aware of what support the young person may need."
    },
    {
        "question": "How often should Circles be offered?",
        "answer": "Circles is intended as an ongoing practice tool. It can be used before during and after Lifelong Links, but can also be used periodically by a social worker to see how a child or young person's network changes over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can additional people be added to Circles during the questionnaire?",
        "answer": "Yes, each question has a plus (+) button available. Simply click on the plus to add more people. The new person will be available for all of the questions before and after the question you are currently on. The <a href='https://frg.org.uk/lifelong-links/lifelong-links-circles/' target='_blank'>Circles film</a> will show you how to do it."
    },
    {
        "question": "How will Circles help with Lifelong Links work and the Lifelong Links family group conference?",
        "answer": "The information you discover when using Circles will help identify people that the young person may want at their Lifelong Links family group conference (FGC). It may also help identify any gaps in the young person's network - for example, they do not have enough people to help them speak up at meetings."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can Circles include people that were important in the past?",
        "answer": "Technically yes, it can include anyone. However, it is designed to look at the young person's current support network. They should be allowed complete freedom to include who they would like. The wording at the start of the questionnaire will help steer everyone in the right direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "The emoji a young person is looking for is not featured.",
        "answer": "We understand that not every person in a network will have an emoji that looks exactly like them. We use Microsoft's 'Fluent Emojis' which are an international bank of emojis. We will be happy to hear about additional emojis that can represent people in young people's lives - Circles@frg.org.uk"
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I bypass emojis and just go to the questions?",
        "answer": "No, the emoji part of this cannot be bypassed. It is integral to answering questions. If a young person does not wish to fully personalise Circles, then they can simply select the silhouette emoji to speed through."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I upload answers to questions if I cannot use the internet?",
        "answer": "If the Circles conversation is held without internet, then you will have to go through the full questionnaire to enter the answers for the young person in a way that will faithfully represent their answers."
    },
    {
        "question": "If I don't finish Circles in one session, will it be saved?",
        "answer": "Yes, progress will always be saved and will show as an incomplete questionnaire when you next log on."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can a young person enter a full name for their important people?",
        "answer": "<strong>No, because of data protection only first name, or first name and last initial, or known-by names should be entered</strong>. For example, Bob, Bob B, or Granddad Bob respectively.."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can a new person be added after the Circles questionnaire has been submitted?",
        "answer": "No, once the questionnaire has been finalised it is a closed document. You can always start a new one in which previous people will be drawn through and a new person will be added."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I use Circles for other children who are not accessing Lifelong Links?",
        "answer": "Yes, but need to be mindful of the Admin will be able to manage the additional oversight and work required for this."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can we fill it in for children and young people who have additional learning needs?",
        "answer": "This is a judgement call from yourself with the young person that is in front of you. If this interface is not working for a young person, then any creativity you can use to have the conversation in another way would be great. Please check this out with the planning meeting group and those that know the young person best."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is there a space for free text and explanations?",
        "answer": "No, there was an option in a previous version, however it was not helpful to coordinators or young people. Circles is optimised for visual interactivity. Any notes needed can be written and discussed by the personal adviser/coordinator/social worker and young person."
    },
    {
        "question": "I am a social worker, how can I reset my password?",
        "answer": "Simply contact your local Circles administrator. This will be a person in your own organisation (not Family Rights Group). They will be able to reset your password."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I delete a young person from the system?",
        "answer": "Any young person can be deleted by the administrator. On the main administrator screen click on 'young people' then the young persons 'Circles ID' and then click 'Delete'. <strong>This action cannot be undone</strong>."
    },
    {
        "question": "I deleted a young person by accident, how do I get them back?",
        "answer": "If you have deleted a young person or their questionnaire. This acion cannot be reversed. Please use this function carefully."
    },
    {
        "question": "The young person has changed their name, will the affect Circles?",
        "answer": "No, Circles uses a date of birth and Child ID. A change of name will not affect the Circles database."
